In the article "Introduction to Real-Time Data Processing Using Apache Kafka and OpenWeatherMap API," Sohail Hosseini offers a comprehensive guide to using Apache Kafka for real-time data processing. The piece is organized into three parts, each focusing on a different Python script.

The first part, "app.py," describes fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and publishing it to a Kafka topic. It involves importing necessary modules, defining the get_weather function to retrieve weather data, and setting up a loop to fetch and send this data to a Kafka topic.

The second part, "consumer_script.py," demonstrates how to consume the weather data from the Kafka topic and print it on the console. This involves creating a Kafka Consumer instance and setting up a loop that continuously polls for new messages.

The third part, "storage_consumer.py," is similar to the second part but instead of printing the data, it stores it in an SQLite database.

The article concludes by explaining how this basic setup serves as a foundation for developing real-time data processing applications using Apache Kafka and Python. However, it emphasizes that a real-world scenario might require more sophisticated configurations such as additional error handling, data validation, and utilization of Kafka's more advanced features.
